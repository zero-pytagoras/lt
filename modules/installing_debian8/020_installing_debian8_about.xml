<para>This module is a step by step demonstration of <command>Debian 11</command>, also known as <command>Bullseye</command> installation from terminal user interface.</para>
<para>We start by downloading an image from the internet and install <command>Debian 11</command> as a virtual machine in <command>Virtualbox</command>. We will also do some basic configuration of this new machine like setting an <command>ip address show</command> and fixing a <command>hostname</command>.</para>
<para>This procedure should be very similar for other versions of <command>Debian</command>, and also for other <command>Debian</command> based distributions such as <command>Linux Mint</command>, <command>Ubuntu/Xubuntu/Kubuntu</command>. This procedure can also be helpful if you are using another virtualization solution.</para>
<para>In case you prefer to use RPM based GNU/Linux, we'd suggest to go to the next chapter where we go over distributions like <command>CentOS, Fedora or Red Hat Enterprise Linux</command> alike.</para>
